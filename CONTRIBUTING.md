## How to contribute to IEEE-TEC-Bot

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in the bot**, instead Pm someone at @TEComputerIEEE.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/TEComputerIEEE/IEEE-TEC-Bot/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/TEComputerIEEE/IEEE-TEC-Bot/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.


#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.


#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Depending on the change we will evaluate to accept or not the PR.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the  [Issues Page](https://github.com/TEComputerIEEE/IEEE-TEC-Bot/issues) and start writing code.


#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about how to use the bot to anyone on @TEComputerIEE.

#### **Do you want to contribute to the Rails documentation?**

* Make the changes you consider necessary and then make a pull request with your PR.
